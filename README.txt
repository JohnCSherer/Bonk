Threw this together in a couple hours to satisfy a friend's craving for the sound effect on-demand.

The actual program is just a single .exe file found in "BonkApp/bin/Release/Bonk.exe".  

Pitch of the sound scales with the size of the window. Right click anywhere to duplicate the window, create a whole piano!
Middle mouse button will set the pitch of the note to be visible, making this much easier.

Application only closes after all windows are closed.
